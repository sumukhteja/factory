                Remix: To combine or edit existing materials to produce something new.
            </p>

            <p>
                The term remix originally applied to music. It became prominent in the last century
                during the rise of hip-hop, the first musical genre to widely incorporate sampling
                from existing recordings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Early example: The Sugarhill Gang sampled the bassline from Good Times by Chic
                in the 1979 hit Rapper’s Delight. Since then, that same bassline has been sampled
                dozens of times.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>Video</li>
                <li>Photos</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Today, anyone can remix anything and distribute it globally almost instantly.
                You don’t need expensive tools. You don’t need a distributor. You don’t even need skills.
            </p>

            <div class="quote">
                Remixing is a folk art. Anyone can do it.
            </div>

            <p>
                Yet the techniques involved—collecting material, transforming it, combining it—
                are the same ones used at every level of creation.
                You could even say: everything is a remix.
            </p>

            <h2>Part 1 — The Song Remains the Same</h2>

            <p>
                To explain this, let’s start in England in 1968.
                Led Zeppelin forms when Jimmy Page recruits John Paul Jones,
                Robert Plant, and John Bonham.
            </p>

            <p>
                They play extremely loud blues that soon becomes known as—
                Wait. Let’s rewind.
            </p>

            <p>
                Paris, 1961. William S. Burroughs coins the term “heavy metal”
                in his novel The Soft Machine.
                That book itself was created using the cut-up technique—
                literally cutting up existing texts and rearranging them.
            </p>

            <p>
                So in 1961, Burroughs not only invents the term heavy metal,
                the genre Led Zeppelin would later pioneer—he also produces
                an early form of remix.
            </p>

            <h2>Led Zeppelin and Copying</h2>

            <p>
                By the mid-1970s, Led Zeppelin is the biggest touring rock band
                in the United States. Yet many critics and peers accuse them of imitation.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bring It On Home borrows its opening and closing from Willie Dixon’s song of the same name</li>
                <li>The Lemon Song uses lyrics from Killing Floor by Howlin’ Wolf</li>
                <li>Black Mountain Side uses the melody from Blackwaterside, arranged by Bert Jansch</li>
                <li>Dazed and Confused is an uncredited cover of a song by Jake Holmes</li>
                <li>Stairway to Heaven opens similarly to Taurus by Spirit</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Led Zeppelin clearly copied a great deal of other people’s material.
                That alone was not unusual.
            </p>

            <p>
                What made them different were two things:
                they did not credit the original artists,
                and they did not transform the material enough to claim originality.
            </p>

            <p>
                British blues bands commonly recorded covers,
                but unlike Zeppelin, they didn’t claim to have written them.
                Most bands emulated a general sound.
                Zeppelin copied specific melodies and lyrics.
            </p>

            <h2>Legal Remix</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Covers – performances of existing material</li>
                <li>Imitations – copies transformed enough to remain within the law</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These account for almost everything the entertainment industry produces.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ironically, after their success, Led Zeppelin went from copying to being copied:
                1970s: Aerosmith, Heart, Boston.
                1980s: heavy metal.
                Later: sampling culture.
            </p>

            <h2>Part 2 — Remix Inc. (Hollywood)</h2>

            <p>
                Most blockbuster films rely heavily on existing material.
                Of the ten highest-grossing films of the past decade,
                the majority are sequels, remakes, or adaptations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hollywood’s greatest skill is turning the old into the new.
                Stories are told, retold, transformed, retold again, and subverted.
            </p>

            <p>
                Genres become subgenres, each with strict conventions.
                Horror splits into supernatural, slasher, zombie, and creature films.
                All reuse and transform familiar elements.
            </p>

            <h2>Star Wars as Remix</h2>

            <p>
                Star Wars remains an extraordinary work of imagination,
                yet its individual components are as recognizable as samples in a remix.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Joseph Campbell and The Hero with a Thousand Faces</li>
                <li>1930s Flash Gordon serials</li>
                <li>Films by Akira Kurosawa</li>
                <li>War films, westerns, and science fiction classics</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                George Lucas collected materials, combined them, and transformed them.
                Without those earlier films, Star Wars would not exist.
                Creation requires influence.
            </p>

            <h2>Quentin Tarantino</h2>

            <p>
                Quentin Tarantino represents the ultimate remix filmmaker.
                Kill Bill is essentially a cinematic mash-up,
                densely packed with elements sampled from countless films.
            </p>

            <h2>Part 3 — The Elements of Creativity</h2>

            <p>
                Creativity is surrounded by myths:
                that it comes from sudden inspiration,
                that original works break all molds,
                that genius creates from nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Creativity is not magic.
                It comes from applying ordinary thinking tools to existing materials.
            </p>

            <h2>Copying Is How We Learn</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Bob Dylan’s first album contained eleven covers</li>
                <li>Richard Pryor began by imitating Bill Cosby</li>
                <li>Hunter S. Thompson retyped The Great Gatsby word for word</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Nobody starts out original.</p>

            <h2>Transformation</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Steam engines</li>
                <li>The QWERTY keyboard</li>
                <li>The light bulb</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These were not isolated inventions but critical points
                in long evolutionary chains.
            </p>

            <h2>Combination</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Gutenberg’s printing press</li>
                <li>Ford’s Model T</li>
                <li>The Internet and the World Wide Web</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The basic elements of creativity are copying,
                transforming, and combining.
            </p>

            <h2>Part 4 — System Failure (Intellectual Property)</h2>

            <p>
                Culture evolves like biology.
                Genes copy, mutate, and combine.
                Ideas—memes—do the same.
            </p>

            <p>
                But our legal systems treat ideas as isolated property.
                Copyright and patents were meant to encourage creation
                and build a rich public domain.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, they expanded into excessive protection,
                litigation culture, and patent and sampling trolls.
            </p>

            <div class="quote">
                Less innovation. More fear. More lawsuits.
            </div>

            <h2>Final Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                Ideas are not neat.
                They overlap, tangle, and build upon each other.
                Everything we create evolves from what came before.
            </p>

            <p>
                Copy. Transform. Combine.<br>
                That’s how culture works.<br>
                That’s how we live.<br>
                That’s how we create.
